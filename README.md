# hello-world
just another repository
hi, my name is yali, and my English name is Iris. I'm a international student from HK China, and I came to America is for learning more new stuff no matter what kind of stuff. I would like to creat a new life in the US if I can because I think the space of the country in the US is so big. In other words, the US having less population than China. I will learn as much as the program have, I hope I can be a good student. THANK YOU.
